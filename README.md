## 🎯 Problem Statement

The core challenge was to:
1. Create a custom geometry class for a Sphere that:
   - Takes in radius, X segments, and Y segments as parameters
   - Generates a buffer geometry for the Sphere
   - Generates UVs and normals for the geometry
2. Use this custom geometry class in a demo project to:
   - Render the Sphere with a texture
   - Implement lighting using the generated normals

## ✨ Features

- 🌍 Custom Sphere geometry with configurable parameters
- 🎨 Texture mapping on the sphere surface
- 💡 Dynamic lighting using calculated normals
- 🌠 Interactive starfield background
- 🎮 Orbital controls for user interaction (rotation, pan, zoom)
- 📱 Responsive design for various screen sizes

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Three.js
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5
- CSS3

## 🚀 Getting Started
